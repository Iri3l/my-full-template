# Lazarovici Web Design

**Welcome!**

This project is my online CV  where I want to show to my clients and my employers who I am and what I'm doing. I also work on adding different projects on what I'm working on so everyone can see them.

## UX

The idea of this project is to offer to my potential clients, and my potential employers details about who I am, the work that I'm doing it. My idea about this project is to make this project as my online visit card for who is interested in my services.

* By promoting my CV http://www.lazarovici.co.uk, I can attract potential customers or employers and having more chances to be found on the internet and social media.

* I also intend to create a small platform linked to this, working with companies I can give them the chance to list their offers there and for the other people to can find the best offers for them.


## Features 

* Continuously working on this project to make a detailed ABOUT ME and my work.
* The entire project is offering to visitors all the information about my work and a list of clients(projects) that may be useful for the ones who are visiting my page.
* I want to link to this another page where I intend to create a small search engine for job offers, where companies can look for workers and also workers looking for a job on their area. The intention is to start doing it for one city 
  and then slowly add another city, a small gumtree, for example. If everything goes well, then I can extend it by adding adds of products and offers for different types of sales that are in each area, and who knows in one day I will 
  create an application for phones which can be added in AppStore or PlayStore.

## Existing Features

* At the moment due to my everyday work, there are not so many features implemented yet, but the can be found the following:
1. On the home page 

	a) can be found personal info about me. 

	b) at the bottom of the page can be found the number of visitors and to whom my credits go. 
2. Resume page
	
    a) includes information about my work history to now.
3. Contact page 
	
    a) include a contact form where the visitor can fill it up then press the send button, and I can receive the email which allows me to contact back the person.
4. Customers page

	a) at the moment is a temporary page where can be found the projects(clients) that I work.			 

## Features Left to Implement

I plan to add a new page, where I can add the companies job offers and where people who are visiting can look for a job or changing their career maybe.
Thinking to make an application which can be downloaded from the AppStore that will help people be notified when a new post is listed.

## Technologies Used
Most used are HTML and CSS. 
* But also few lines of PHP code for the contact form to be responsive,  where the visitor can contact me. 
 
 ## Testing

The site was tested on different types of mobile phones, tablets and PC. The most critical issue which took me time to sort it out was with the footer of the page, the alignment of the icons varies on windows products and apple products, and the same on android and iOS. 
But this was corrected now, and as far I am aware everything is working and looking as its should.
The contact form is working good, and it is responsive as well. 

## Deployment
The first version is on GitHub https://github.com/Iri3l/my-full-template/blob/master/resume-project/index.html this is where this project was created. 
Then the version was moved on a different branch and downloaded on to PC too. 
I use Visual Studio Code to edit/upgrade the code on my PC version. Then I used Cyberduck for transferring the code to my hosting server.

The code on GitHub is not complete and is not upgraded due to my hectic time, was easy for me to work on my PC because sometimes the internet connection was poor.

The latest version of the project is hosted on https://lazarovici.co.uk/
